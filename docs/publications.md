# Editing the Publications Page

The Publications page will be changed into something a bit better in the near future, but in the mean time, simply add citations as a bullet point in the list.

Visitors are also invited to see our Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and Internet Archive Scholar pages, which are likely pretty up-to-date.
