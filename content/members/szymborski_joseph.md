Joseph has spent the last 7 years studying cancer biology from both computational and experimental perspectives. These studies were conducted as part of his Master's Degree in Experimental Medicine and Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry, both granted by McGill University. For the period between those degrees, Joseph was employed as a Machine Learning Developer at Coveo Solutions. He is the recipient of the prestigious Les Vadasz Doctoral Fellowships in Engineering. His research interests include creating computational tools for the analysis of single-cell omics data, particularly as applied to the context of cancers.
