We are interested in developing computational models to predict the clinical drug response of patients based on pre-clinical samples such as cell lines. In addition, we would like to identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and novel therapeutic targets in diseases such as cancers, cystic fibrosis, COPD, etc.
